A simple Project, reminding us crazy coders (strong alliteration) to take a break every x mins. 'x' as you choose the time (in seconds) before one of your favourite songs pops up in a brand new window, and encourages you to stand up, boogey down, and clear the brain.

You can add/edit/delete existing links to your liking, however, I believe you will be quite impressed with the list when you see it!
